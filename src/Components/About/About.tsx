               When Rachel looks at the world, her mind wants to translate what she sees into paintings. She has loved
               to create since she was young, but didn't fully embrace her artistic abilities until the last few years
               when she decided she needed to spend more time developing her skills and doing what she loves. Rachel
               has worked in non-profits for the last 13 years, but is now focusing on her artwork. She lives in
               St. Charles, IL with her two energetic elementary-aged sons that like to paint alongside her. Her
               artwork allows Rachel to express herself and share with others the beauty that's right in front of us
               every day.

               Mostly self-taught, Rachel's work usually focuses on landscapes that showcase her love for nature,
               mountains and the ocean. She grew up in Illinois, but frequently visited Colorado with her family
               growing up. Rocky Mountain scenes are especially close to her heart. She wants her viewers to have a
               sense of peace and appreciation of the outdoors when they see her work. Acrylic paints are Rachel's
               medium of choice, but she has also enjoyed other mediums, such as graphite and oil.
